Case Study
Medicaid Optimization Program

Scaled an eligibility and payment platform to handle seasonal surges without compromising accuracy.

    Advanced load / soak testing paired with observability deep dives
    Automated regression harness to replay real-world traffic
    Achieved a 70% performance boost while cutting infra spend 30%

   Medicaid Optimization Program

Load testing, telemetry, and automation that lifted throughput 70% while reducing infrastructure spend 30%.

Challenge
Keeping Medicaid access reliable during surge season

The state partner’s eligibility and payment platform served hundreds of thousands of residents, infrastructure migrations exposed brittle infrastructure and manual release practices. The result: slow determinations, frustrated constituents, and expensive war rooms.

We delivered a cross-functional tiger team to model realistic traffic, uncover cascading performance issues, and automate remediation so the program could scale confidently.
Impact snapshot

    70% throughput lift on the most critical workflows.
    30% infrastructure savings by right-sizing compute and storage tiers.
    Zero priority-one incidents during the subsequent enrollment period.

Bottleneck discovery

Synthetic load, soak, and chaos tests mapped how eligibility calculations, payment adjudication, and document generation behaved under load surges.

Observability everywhere

We wired application tracing, infra telemetry, and business KPIs into a single command center so executives could see user impact in real time.

Actionable playbooks

Capacity runbooks, cost-rightsizing guidance, and compliance-ready documentation ensured the state partner could sustain improvements long term.
What we delivered

    Performance lab with automated load/stress tests mapped directly to service-level objectives.
    Golden signals and KPIs pushed into a single pane of glass for business + engineering leadership.
    Modules to scale horizontally and rollback safely.
    Runbooks and tabletop exercises that trained engineering teams on capacity management best practices.

Case Study
DEA CI/CD & Security Hardening

Modernized releases for sensitive investigative workloads with policy-as-code and zero-trust guardrails.

    Blended DevSecOps platform with STIG-based baselines
    Integrated policy gates into multi-stage pipelines
    Reduced deployment risk while maintaining velocity

DEA CI/CD & Security Hardening

DevSecOps platform that fused zero-trust governance with rapid delivery for investigative workloads.

Mission
Modern tooling with uncompromising security

The DEA’s investigative teams rely on specialized software to coordinate field operations. Legacy delivery processes slowed feature velocity and made it hard to prove compliance across agencies.

We partnered with in-house engineers to implement a hardened DevSecOps platform—introducing automated governance, safer releases, and dashboards that satisfied both cyber and mission leadership.
Impact snapshot

    40% faster release cadence with no critical findings in ATO reviews.
    Automated gates blocked misconfigured infrastructure before it reached production.
    Shared observability connected cyber teams and mission owners via one dashboard.

Discuss secure delivery

Policy-as-code

DoD/DHS baseline controls encoded as reusable checks that run automatically within pipelines and runtime clusters.

Secure supply chain

SBOM generation, signing, and artifact provenance tracked across build stages to meet FedRAMP+ expectations.

Mission-ready delivery

Release trains coordinated with field offices so investigative tooling shipped predictably without downtime.
What we delivered

    Reusable IaC modules with STIG-compliant defaults.
    End-to-end CI/CD pipelines with SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and policy-as-code stages.
    Centralized SBOM + artifact signing for every build.
    Playbooks aligning release trains with mission planning cycles.

Case Study
NASA Content Delivery System

Built a resilient data platform to move telemetry, science packets, and immersive training assets worldwide.

    Designed distributed caching and replication
    Established repeatable release governance
    3D gamified geo-referencing exercises for students

NASA Content Delivery System

Distributed platform that moved science, telemetry, and immersive training media at mission speed.

Exploration
Delivering mission data everywhere

NASA teams needed to stream telemetry, high-fidelity imagery, and interactive simulations to collaborators across the globe. We designed and implemented systems which could handle the blend of real-time feeds, archived assets, and immersive training modules.

We engineered a distributed content delivery mesh with automated replication, data governance, and release controls so critical information reached students, scientists, and external partners without delay.
Impact snapshot

    99.95% availability across global data mirrors.
    Faster training cycles with immersive geo exercises.

Plan your platform

Global content mesh

Satellite, lab, and training data synchronized across multiple regions.

Immersive training

3D gaming-inspired geo-referencing exercises helped students internalize mission-critical procedures.

Governed releases

Repeatable change management playbooks aligned contractors, NASA stakeholders, and partner agencies.
What we delivered

    Multi-region content delivery network tuned for mixed workloads (streaming + bulk transfer).
    Automated metadata tagging, retention enforcement, and partner-specific access controls.
    Interactive 3D geo-referenced training applications built with gaming engines.
    Release governance and readiness reviews aligned with NASA requirements.
